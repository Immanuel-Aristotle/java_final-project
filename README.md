# video-making

OK and this is my Grade 11 S2 end java GUI project. In this video I will do a review of this project. Firstly do a simple demonstration of the program. Secondly I will mention parts of the code where I learned something new. And Finally I will explain the problems I've struggled with when making this program.

What I've learned:

1. grid layout of JFrame
2. timer for actionlistener
3. JOptionPane show message
4. StringBuilder
5. locale

Problems I met:

1. change font size according to tile size

Future improvements can be done:

1. a finishing notification message with timer and game score

The video outcome seems to be pretty nice!ðŸ¥³
