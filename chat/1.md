Lets do the math. If $rows=4, col=4, identicalTilesToCancel=3$, then the maximum number of different alphabets needed for the game is `ceiling(4*4/3)=6`, which means A-F. Thus, the tiles plane must be a 4*4 square PLUS 2 additional tiles at the end of that square. Do modifications on the file to meet that goal.
