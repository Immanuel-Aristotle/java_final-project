Can we change a way of inquering the gamer. Instead of asking them rows, cols, and identicalTilesToCancel, we ask them DIRECTLY the number of different tile they want in the entire panel and the identicalTilesToCancel, which means, rows*cols = (that number) * identicalTilesToCancel. Then, we arrange rows and cols SO THAT abs(ros-cols) is the smallest for all integer combinations of rows and cols.
